## Introduction 
Solar energy installation is a significant investment, and estimating the energy output accurately before installation is crucial for stakeholders, such as energy companies, government agencies and homeowners. This can help improve budgeting, reduce unnecessary costs, and optimize resource allocation.
## Problem Definition
### Predicting Energy Potential for Solar Intallations
 
In recent years, the demand for renewable energy sources like solar power has increased significantly. Solar energy has a huge potential, but accurately predicting the energy potential from solar installations depends on various factors such as geographical location, building characteristics, and environmental conditions. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the energy potential for solar installations based on various input features.
